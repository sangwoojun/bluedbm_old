1. Setting up the environment 
	(1) Decompress an xbsv version from xbsv_backup to where bluedbm is located,
	so that the two directories are in the same parent directory 
	(2) Building can be done in the respective framework directory, for example,
	flashemul.  For example, building the [flashemul] framework with [emultest]
	configuration can be done like the following:
		cd flashemul;
		make emultest;
		cd vc707;
		make;

2. Code structure
	Only some special directories can exist on the top level; [src], [config],
	[xbsv_backups] and various framework directories, in which you will run
	make. All other directories which contain code, etc must exist inside [src].

	In config, there are multiple Makefiles, including Makefile.list which is
	included by the Makefiles inside each framework Makefile to configure the
	files and arguments used to build. For example, the configuration inside
	Makefile.emultest can be used by running
		make emultest;

	Ideally, code should be modularized enough so that any configuration can be
	used in any framework. Please keep this in mind when you write code.

	Also, please mind the directory structure inside [src] when writing new
	code. Different, interchangeable modules and code should be stored together
	inside the same directory, in their respective directories.


3. when copying over a new version of xbsv 
	(1) Copy ddr3 related files 
	(2) Copy and flatten ddr3_v1_7 from
	BLUESPECDIR/board_support/bluenoc/xilinx/VC707/verilog/ddr3_v1_7/ 
	(3) Copy DDR3_synthesis_constraints from
	BLUESPECDIR/board_support/bluenoc/xilinx/VC707/ to
	xbsv/constraints/vc707_ddr3.xdc . Edit vc707_ddr3.xdc such that the
	contraint names fit pins_* instead of DDR3_*
